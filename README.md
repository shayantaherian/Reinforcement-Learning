# Reinforcement Learning with pytorch
This is repository will implement the classic and state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms using pytorch. The goal of this repository is to provide an easy to read pytorch reinforcement laernng implementation.

### What is included?
Currently this respository includes the agents:
* Deep Q-learning [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602)
* Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971)
