# Reinforcement Learning with pytorch
This is repository will implement the classic and state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms using pytorch. The goal of this repository is to provide an easy to read pytorch reinforcement laernng implementation.

### What is included?
Currently this respository includes the agents:
* Deep Q-learning [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602)
* Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971)

### Requirements
* Python 3.7
* gym >= 0.10
* pytorch >= 0.4

### Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

In case failing with installation:

* Install gym environment
```
pip install gym 
```

* Install pytorch
```
please go to official webisite to install it: https://pytorch.org/

Recommend use Anaconda Virtual Environment to manage your packages
```
